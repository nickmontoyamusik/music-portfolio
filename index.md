Nick is a second-year master’s student in Musicology from Santaquin, Utah. His current research interests include Indonesian folk music, modern/contemporary dance accompaniment, participatory music, improvisation in rhythmic entrainment, and weird instruments, specifically Indonesian jaw harps.

His master’s thesis topic is focused on the music of the Balinese jaw harp known as genggong. For Nick, musical performance and practice is a non-negotiable priority in his musicological research. He has participated in various ensembles at FSU, namely the Balinese Gamelan, Brazilian Ensemble, Steel Band, Polymorphia New Music Ensemble, Wind Ensemble, and the Global Baroque Touring Ensemble. He regularly plays percussion/piano for modern/contemporary dance classes at the FSU School of Dance and takes gigs around Tallahassee. Outside of music, Nick enjoys learning languages, being outside in Florida humidity, and playing more music.
